# Smart Music Recommendation System

## Introduction

This project is a smart music recommendation system designed to enhance the user experience by providing personalized music recommendations based on user preferences, popular trends, and highly rated music. The system integrates advanced features like voice assistance and video recommendations to make it more interactive and user-friendly.

## Features

- **Personalized Music Recommendations:** Based on user history, preferences, and popular music trends.
- **Video Recommendations:** Suggests music videos alongside audio tracks.
- **Voice Assistant Integration:** Hands-free interaction allowing users to request music via voice commands.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Developed using Kotlin to run on multiple operating systems.
- **Firebase Analytics Integration:** Monitors user interactions to improve recommendation accuracy.

## Modules

1. **User:** Interacts with the application to receive music recommendations.
2. **Application:** The core module where music is recommended and played.
3. **Algorithm Service:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms (content-based and collaborative filtering) to generate recommendations.
4. **Database:** Stores user profiles and music playlists.

## Project Design

### Existing System
Most current music recommendation systems rely on user profile analysis using basic filtering techniques. These systems often lack innovation and do not fully consider user preferences.

### Proposed System
The proposed system uses a hybrid recommendation approach, combining content-based and collaborative filtering to provide more accurate and personalized music recommendations. The system also suggests related videos and integrates a voice assistant for hands-free usage.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Get Sample Code:** Start with the provided codebase.
2. **Import Starter App:** Import the project into Android Studio.
3. **Create Firebase Console Project:** Set up Firebase for data management and analytics.
4. **Run the Starter App:** Launch the initial version on a device.
5. **Add Firebase Analytics:** Integrate to track user interactions.
6. **Export Data to BigQuery:** Analyze data for model training.
7. **Preprocess and Train Model:** Use TensorFlow Lite for the recommendation model.
8. **Integrate the Model:** Implement the trained model into the app.
9. **Run the App:** Test the final version with music and video recommendations.

## Testing

- **Unit Testing:** Ensures the functionality of the recommendation system, particularly the music recommendation and playback features.


## Conclusion and Future Scope

The Smart Music Recommendation System successfully delivers personalized music and video recommendations. Future improvements may include refining the recommendation algorithms and expanding the system's features based on user feedback.
